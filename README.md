# Introduction
This angular project should be able to perform all the CRUD operations around user information, and store them in the browser localStorage

# Background
The current implementation only shows parts of the user information in a grid, and can also create a new user. There has been pretty much no styling applied to the website, and the pages has been built in a monolithic way, instead of using components

# TODO
1) Ensure all the basic CRUD operations can be performed on this website
2) All the inputs, buttons and icons should be converted into re-usable components that should be referenced throughout the website
3) Find, and complete the TODO comments in the website
4) Implement the styling as per the Adobe XD file included in the project under `/designs/User_Form_Website.xd`
